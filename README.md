Have You Fed Your Dog Yet? (iOS)

##MVP

###Views

Screen 1. from top to bottom:  
label "did you just feed your dog?"  
button "YES I DID" (pushes Screen 2)

Screen 2. from top to bottom:  
label "Great job!"  
button "Whoops, that was a mistake"

###Model

When the user hits the button, a new Feeding object is created which logs the time of feeding.

##Future Features

Vaguely in order of roadmap:

- a notification "it's been a while since you've fed your dog, maybe he's getting hungry?"
- track multiple pets
- specify what went into the meal
- "favorite" certain meals (for instance if you feed your pet the same thing every day)
- track Poop events too. should include (at least): time, Bristol value, which direction the dog was facing (compass tie-in?)
- did the meal contain medication?
- did the dog eat it all at once or save some for later?

- share records with other people who have the app, so that even while asleep/on vacation I can see that my dog(s) receives appropriate feedings and poopings.
- machine learning to see patterns in when the dog likes to eat and poop
